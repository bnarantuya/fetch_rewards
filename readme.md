This is an assessment from Fetch Rewards.

Description
I have used ReactJS with no additional packages. I used express in order to get data from 
`https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json`, avoiding CORS.

Instruction:  
`npm intall` to install packages
`npm run build ` to build react app
`npm start` to start server and serve from build folder
`npm run start:react` to start react app in dev mode
